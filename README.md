# linear-and-neural-sentiment-classification

The goal of this project is to learn about Linear Classifiers and Neural Networks by comparing and contrasting how these work with Sentiment Analysis. In this project, it is also required to understand how feature extraction works for linear models alongside observing how the standard pipeline is used in many NLP tasks and discern how it compares with a Neural Network based on word embeddings. I have also worked on two exploration pieces that involve implementing Bigram Feature Extraction and trying out a few different schedules for the step size.
